# Aidan Bradley (@LinuxMainframe) üëã

Hi, I'm Aidan, a senior Chemistry major at the University of Connecticut with a passion for blending advanced chemistry with real-world tech solutions. Self-taught in programming, I‚Äôve built production-grade systems for livestream automation, embedded hardware, and network infrastructure over 3+ years. My chemistry expertise includes analytical techniques, synthetic organic chemistry, and novel transition metal compounds. I‚Äôm developing personal open-source lab equipment to make advanced tools accessible to students. Currently learning the Qt Framework, I/O, threading, and multiprocessing to enhance my application development skills. I‚Äôm eager to contribute to open-source projects and secure internships or part-time roles in software development, embedded systems, scientific computing, or cybersecurity.

## üëÄ Interests
- Python and C application development
- Embedded systems (Raspberry Pi Pico, microcontrollers)
- Networking and infrastructure automation (ProxMox, Ubiquiti, PoE)
- Analytical chemistry (HPLC, spectrometry) and synthetic organic chemistry
- Open-source lab equipment design (fluid handling, reaction monitoring)
- Cybersecurity (network security, ethical hacking)

## üå± Currently Learning
- **Qt Framework**: Building cross-platform GUI applications
- **I/O, Threading, Multiprocessing**: Optimizing performance in Python and C
- **Cybersecurity Tools**: Nmap, Wireshark for network analysis
- **Advanced Chemistry**: Polymerizations, phase transfer biochemistry, custom lab hardware

## üíª Key Projects
- **[OPS-Live-Controller](https://github.com/LinuxMainframe/OPS-Live-Controller)**  
  Python-based automation suite for OBS Studio, powering 24/7 livestreams for paintball tournaments. Manages 16+ IP cameras with FFmpeg/RTMP, WebSockets, and v4l2loopback, achieving zero downtime over 3 years. Features exponential retries and quality scoring for stream reliability.  
- **[RPiPicoMAX6921lib](https://github.com/LinuxMainframe/RPiPicoMAX6921lib)**  
  C library for RP2040/2030 microcontrollers to drive MAX6921 LED displays via SPI. Planned to be a library for the maxim chip + vfd combo.  
- **Persistent IP Camera Connector (libpicc)**  
  Modular C library for persistent RTMP connections to IP PoE cameras, with stream quality scoring and recovery states. Tested with Valgrind (94% pass rate) and integrated with virtual devices. *(In development, private repo)*  
- **ProxMox Cluster Infrastructure**  
  Configured a 3-node cluster on HP ProLiant servers (Gen7/8), testing applications like Ente (S3/Redis) and headless Debian LXC containers for multi-machine script deployment. Managed 1000-2000ft of PoE cabling and Ubiquiti hardware for network reliability.  
- **Personal Chemistry & Open-Source Lab Equipment Projects**  
  Conducted academic research at UConn in analytical chemistry (HPLC, Analytical Instrumentation) and synthetic organic chemistry, including McMurray Coupling for porphyrin synthesis and novel titanium complexes. Studied polymerizations and biochemistry (phase transfer, drug transfer in homogenized solutions like stomach/bile systems). Developing personal open-source lab tools (in progress), including contactless fluid pumps, load-cell circuitry, a DIY spectrophotometer, and reaction monitoring systems to provide cost-effective solutions for students.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills
- **Programming**: Python (asyncio, Selenium, FFmpeg), C (thread-safety, API design), HTML/CSS/JS (basic)
- **Systems & Networking**: ProxMox, LXC, Docker basics, PoE standards, Ubiquiti configuration, cable termination, fault isolation
- **Embedded**: RP2040/2030, SPI, KiCad circuit design, radar/MCU integration
- **Chemistry**: Analytical (HPLC, spectrometry), synthetic organic (McMurray Coupling, porphyrins), transition metal complexes (titanium), polymerizations, biochemistry (phase transfer, drug transfer)
- **Lab Equipment Design**: Contactless fluid handling, load-cell circuits, DIY spectrophotometry, reaction monitoring (in development)
- **Tools**: Git, Valgrind/Helgrind, OBS WebSockets, v4l2loopback, Doxygen
- **Soft Skills**: Problem-solving, documentation (READMEs with diagrams), project management

## üèÜ Achievements
- **Charles E. Warring Chemistry Scholarship**, UConn (2024)
- **Cum Laude**, NJCL Latin Honor Society
- **Volunteer**, Science Olympiad (3D protein modeling instructor)
- **AP Scores**: Computer Science A (4), Chemistry (4), Psychology (4)

## üíûÔ∏è Collaboration
I‚Äôm excited to contribute to open-source projects in:
- Media automation (e.g., OBS, FFmpeg plugins)
- Embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, IoT)
- Cybersecurity tools or network automation
- Computational chemistry or open-source lab equipment design
