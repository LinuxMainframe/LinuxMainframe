**Tools:** FFmpeg, OBS WebSockets, Valgrind/Helgrind, v4l2loopback, Doxygen

## Featured Projects

**[OPS-Live-Controller](https://github.com/LinuxMainframe/OPS-Live-Controller)** – Production automation system managing 16+ IP cameras for 24/7 paintball tournament livestreams. Built with Python, FFmpeg, and WebSockets; features automatic failover, stream quality scoring, and exponential retry logic. Deployed as systemd services with 3 years of uptime.

**[libwsv5](https://github.com/LinuxMainframe/libwsv5)** – Thread-safe C library implementing OBS WebSocket v5 protocol with full RPC-JSON support. Handles authentication, event subscriptions, and multi-instance connections for production broadcast control.

**[RPiPicoMAX6921lib](https://github.com/LinuxMainframe/RPiPicoMAX6921lib)** – C library for RP2040 microcontrollers driving VFD displays via SPI. Includes timing optimization and bit-order management for hardware interfacing. Applied in custom velocity detection circuits for tournament paintball chronography.

**Paintball Chronography System** *(in development)* – Modern FPS measurement system replacing 1989 hardware, integrating BGT24LTR11N16 radar with STM32L476 MCU. Designed for ultra-low power consumption and field deployment across tournament venues nationwide.

**ProxMox Cluster Lab** – 3-node HP ProLiant cluster for testing containerized applications. Implemented automated backups, LXC deployment pipelines, and network segmentation for development workflows.

**Network Infrastructure** – Designed tournament-grade networks supporting 500+ concurrent users with outdoor CAT6 installations, Ubiquiti dual-band WiFi, spanning tree protocol, and custom Nmap monitoring scripts for device management.

## Chemistry & Lab Development

Undergraduate research in analytical and synthetic organic chemistry at UConn, including HPLC/GCMS analysis, McMurray coupling for porphyrin synthesis, and titanium photocatalyst development. Currently building open-source lab equipment: contactless fluid pumps, load-cell measurement circuits, DIY spectrophotometers, and reaction monitoring systems to reduce costs for student researchers.

## Currently Learning

Qt Framework for cross-platform applications • Advanced I/O and multiprocessing optimization • Network security tools (Nmap, Wireshark) • Quantum chemistry methods (QFT, TDDFT) for computational modeling

## Recognition

**Charles E. Warring Chemistry Scholarship** (UConn, 2024) • **Cum Laude**, NJCL Latin Honor Society • Science Olympiad volunteer instructor • AP Computer Science A (4), Chemistry (4)

## Open to Opportunities

Seeking internships or part-time roles in software development, embedded systems, scientific computing, or cybersecurity. Interested in contributing to open-source projects involving media automation, IoT, network tools, or computational chemistry.
